- [ ] **Custom Names**: Custom member names persist correctly

### **Cargo Configuration JSON**
- [ ] **Storage**: Cargo config properly stored as JSON in database
- [ ] **Retrieval**: Cargo configuration loads correctly when editing vessel
- [ ] **Conditional Data**: Different operation types store appropriate sections
- [ ] **Vehicle Types**: Dynamic vehicle type data persists

---

## **ðŸ§ª Test 6: Progressive Disclosure & UX**

### **Step Navigation**
- [ ] **Forward Navigation**: Can't proceed without required fields
- [ ] **Conditional Validation**: Validation rules adapt to selections
- [ ] **Step Indicators**: Progress indicators update correctly
- [ ] **Back Navigation**: Previous data preserved when going back

### **Document Auto-fill**
- [ ] **Step 1**: Document upload and auto-fill working
- [ ] **Step 2**: Team assignment document processing
- [ ] **Step 3**: Cargo document auto-fill functional
